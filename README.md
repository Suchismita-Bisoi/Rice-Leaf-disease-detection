🌾 **Rice Leaf Disease Classification Web App**
**Deep Learning | TensorFlow | Streamlit | Hugging Face Spaces**
This project is a web-based application that detects rice leaf diseases from images using a deep learning model trained in TensorFlow/Keras.
Users can upload a rice leaf image, view the image, and get the predicted disease instantly.

The model is saved as an H5 file, and the UI is built using Streamlit and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

🚀 **Features**

- Upload rice leaf images

- See live image preview

- Predict diseases using a trained TensorFlow model

- Modern Streamlit interface

- Free deployment using Hugging Face Spaces

🧪 **Supported Classes**

- Bacterial Leaf Blight

- Brown Spot

- Leaf Smut

🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- Component	Technology
- Model	TensorFlow / Keras (.h5 model)
- UI	Streamlit
- Deployment	Hugging Face Spaces
- Language	Python 3.10 / 3.11
